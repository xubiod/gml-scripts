Want to add something? First, [go here.](http://www.gmlscripts.com/script/index) I don't want to add anything from gmlscripts.com (If I add anything that is on the site, it's probably a coincidence. I don't check there often.) If it's not there, yet you want to add a script, [create a pull request!](https://github.com/xubiod/gml-scripts/pulls)

These are scripts for use in GameMaker: Studio 1.4.x and GameMaker Studio 2.x.
